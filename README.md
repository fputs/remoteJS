# remoteJS

## Spawn a remote shell in a client's browser.

This is a proof of concept, hence the code is not up to standard for production servers.

Additionally, this tool has the potential to be used for malicious use, such as inserting form controls, using autocomplete to fill them, and then submitting them, all without any user interaction. 

Furthermore spear phising attacks can be carried out by sending specific content to different people dynamically, including alerts and popups.

## Requirements
To use remoteJS, you will need Python 3.
Additionally, you will need to install some dependencies:

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage
To startup the server and interpreter, enter the following:
```python3 wwwserver.py```
